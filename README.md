# TeamMOBI
**Team Members**: Liora, Riya, Debora, Isha, Avva
**Aim**: Minimize the number of required data streams and create a regressor to see the relationship between Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) targets and data streams of interest. Reduction of input variables will reduce processing time and directly lowers the testing time and resources requires for patient examination and experimentation.
